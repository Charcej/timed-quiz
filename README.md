# Timed Quiz

## Purpose
A timed quiz that consists of five questions, with four multiple choice options to choose from, all centred around knowledge acquired in the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. When the quiz begins you have 75 seconds to complete it. If you get a question wrong, 10 seconds are docked from your total time. If you complete it the final time count becomes your score. You get a chance to enter you initials and submit them to a high score page. 

## This Version
This is my first attempt at this and it went pretty well. However, I do hope to do another version soon that completes it. I unfortunately didn't have enough time to complete everything I wanted to in this one. There should be a link on the first page that links to high scores, when you enter your intials that should be two buttons in addition to the submit button: a 'go back' and a 'delete high scores'. There should also be a list of high scores, at least a Top 5. I was able to store the one score with initials in local storage but ran out of time to do the rest.
